Here‚Äôs the **SRE-friendly breakdown** of common **load balancing algorithms**, with examples of where they‚Äôre used in real systems.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Round Robin**

* **How it works:** Sends each new request to the next backend in sequence, looping around.
* **Use case:** Simple, even distribution when all servers have similar capacity.
* **Example:** NGINX default LB method for HTTP.
* **Pros:** Easy to implement, predictable.
* **Cons:** Ignores server load; can overload slow nodes.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Weighted Round Robin**

* **How it works:** Like Round Robin, but servers have weights; higher weight gets more requests.
* **Use case:** Mix of big and small servers.
* **Example:** F5 BIG-IP, NGINX `weight` parameter.
* **Pros:** Handles heterogeneous capacity.
* **Cons:** Weights must be tuned manually.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Least Connections**

* **How it works:** Sends new requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
* **Use case:** Good for long-lived or unevenly sized requests.
* **Example:** HAProxy `leastconn` algorithm.
* **Pros:** Adapts to current load.
* **Cons:** Needs accurate connection tracking; may not suit stateless short requests.

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Weighted Least Connections**

* **How it works:** Combines server capacity weight with least-connections choice.
* **Use case:** Mix of high-capacity and low-capacity nodes with varying active load.
* **Example:** HAProxy, AWS ALB target group settings.
* **Pros:** Balances both capacity and load.
* **Cons:** Slightly more complex to tune.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Least Response Time**

* **How it works:** Sends to the server with the lowest average response time (and/or fewest active connections).
* **Use case:** Web APIs with variable backend performance.
* **Example:** NGINX Plus, Envoy advanced LB.
* **Pros:** Reacts to slow servers.
* **Cons:** Needs good health/latency metrics.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ IP Hash / Source Hash**

* **How it works:** Hash client IP ‚Üí pick a backend based on hash result.
* **Use case:** Simple session persistence (‚Äústickiness‚Äù) without cookies.
* **Example:** NGINX `ip_hash`, Envoy `hash_policy`.
* **Pros:** Sticky sessions without extra state.
* **Cons:** Poor balance if clients are unevenly distributed; breaks if client IP changes (NAT).

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ URL Hash / Header Hash**

* **How it works:** Hash based on request URL, header, or cookie.
* **Use case:** Cache servers; same content request ‚Üí same server.
* **Example:** CDN edge caches.
* **Pros:** Good cache hit rate.
* **Cons:** Doesn‚Äôt adapt to server load.

---

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ Random with Two Choices**

* **How it works:** Pick two random backends ‚Üí choose the one with fewer active connections.
* **Use case:** High-scale systems; better than pure random.
* **Example:** Some cloud LBs, internal service mesh implementations.
* **Pros:** Simple, avoids worst-case imbalance.
* **Cons:** Still not as precise as least-connections.

---

## **9Ô∏è‚É£ Consistent Hashing**

* **How it works:** Hash key (IP, user ID, etc.) ‚Üí map to backend on a ring. Only remaps a small portion of keys when nodes change.
* **Use case:** Distributed caches (Memcached, Cassandra).
* **Example:** Envoy `ring_hash`, Maglev in GCP LBs.
* **Pros:** Stable routing, minimizes cache misses when scaling.
* **Cons:** More complex; doesn‚Äôt balance perfectly.

---

## **üîü Geolocation-based**

* **How it works:** Route client to nearest (or regionally assigned) server.
* **Use case:** Global CDNs, multi-region apps.
* **Example:** Cloudflare, AWS Route 53 geolocation routing.
* **Pros:** Low latency for users.
* **Cons:** Can cause uneven load; location detection may be wrong.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Performance/Cost Aware**

* **How it works:** Route based on backend metrics (CPU, memory, cost) or cloud pricing.
* **Use case:** Cost optimization or workload-aware routing.
* **Example:** Custom service mesh policies, GKE multi-cluster ingress with load awareness.
* **Pros:** Smart resource use.
* **Cons:** Needs accurate telemetry; more complex.

---

üí° **Interview Tip:**
If they ask *‚ÄúWhich LB algorithm would you pick?‚Äù*:

* First: clarify **traffic pattern** (short-lived? long-lived? even or bursty? needs stickiness?).
* Then: choose algo that balances **fairness vs cost vs complexity**.
* Always mention **health checks** ‚Äî no LB algo works well if you send traffic to broken backends.
